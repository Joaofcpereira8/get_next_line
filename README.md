# Get Next Line

Description:

- Developed the "Get Next Line" project, a fundamental exercise in parsing and file manipulation. The primary objective was to create a function that reads a file line by line and handles dynamic memory allocation appropriately. This project required a deep understanding of file I/O operations and memory management.

Key Achievements:

- Implemented a robust and efficient solution to read and retrieve lines from a file.

- Demonstrated mastery in managing dynamic memory allocation and freeing resources to prevent memory leaks.

- Enhanced error handling mechanisms for a reliable and resilient function.
